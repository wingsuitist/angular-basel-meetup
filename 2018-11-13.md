## CSRF with Angular and SpringBoot

Cross-Site Request Forgery (aka XSRF)

----

### CSRF - Context

*   HTTP is stateless
*   preserve session with cookie
    *   cookie can not be read from script from other domain
    *   but cookie is submitted for any request going to it's domain, no matter who initiated request

----

### CSRF - How it works

*   user is logged into site A and site B (e.g. in different tabs)
*   site B sends a request to the backend of site A
    *   cookie from site A gets sent along
    *   user is considered authenticated

----

### CSRF - How to prevent it

*   prove, that request was actually made from site A
*   send along cookie value as header parameter as well
    *   only possible for scripts of site A
    *   if header and cookie don't match -> reject at backend
*   builds on Same-origin policy

----

### SpringBoot

*   enabled per default when security is enabled
*   sets Cookie with name X-XSRF-TOKEN on every request
*   updates token on each request

Note: changing token on each request adds some more security, but not much

----

### Angular

if there is a cookie _X-XSRF-TOKEN_, it's value is attached as a header _X-XSRF-Token_


----

### Pitfalls

*   SpringBoot makes Token HTTP-Only per default
*   custom header interceptor
