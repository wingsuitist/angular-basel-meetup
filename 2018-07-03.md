## Writing Unit Tests for Angular Components


----

### Background

*   frontend dev
*   experience in unit testing in Java and JavaScript (but not in Angular)
*   first own project, starting from scratch

----

### Motivation for this presentation
*   error messages hard to understand at first -> give you a headstart
*   understand it better myself

----

### Tips

*   test right from the start
*   have tests running while developing
*   continuous integration
*   ask yourself repeatedly: what do I actually want to test?
*   isolate - mock away as much as possible
*   practice
